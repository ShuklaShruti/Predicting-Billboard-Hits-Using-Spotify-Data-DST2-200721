Technocolab DataScience Internship project

Predicting Billboard Hits Using Spotify Data

Overview:
In this project, I tried to predict whether the song will feature on BillBoard Hot 100 or not.For this project, I have used 2 dataset, BillBoard and MSD Features.
Firstly, Exploratory Data Analysis is performed on the dataset inorder to cleanup the data, and change all values to desirable datatype and to derive insights from the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis on BillBoard_features and MSD_Features:
Any dataset that is to be used to perform analysis on, needs to be prepared before we
conduct analysis on that.The data available might contain some discrepancies, and
might not be consistent, to avoid all these affecting our analysis , Exploratory Data
Analysis was performed on the numerical datasets (in csv format). In our EDA we have,
● Imported the data
● Imported all the required libraries
● Got to know about the data, Know the head, tail, get a sample from the data.
Find the sum of all missing values. As there were no missing values in our data
set, we moved on to change data into their desired data types.
● Plotted insights from the EDA.


Algorithm:
We have used 2 algorithms to predict the accuracy.
1.) SVM
2.) Random Forest
